My name is Mike LaBlanc, this is my story. I was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I am one of four kids and I am
the only boy. I have a big family on both side of the family. My mom is one of eight kids and my dad is one of five. Needless
to say, our family get to gethers are always a great time. I went to St. John Vianney Grade School in Brookfield, Wisconsin
where I played basketball. After grade school I attended Milwaukee Pius High School and I played basketball, soccer and golf.
f you can't tell, I love to play sports. Basketball is my favorite.

I currently live in Milwuakee by Miller Park. I wish i would go to more Brewer games than I do, even though they suck.
I have a dog named Hank and he just turned one in December.
